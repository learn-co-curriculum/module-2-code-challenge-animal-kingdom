### Animal Kingdom

Welcome to the Animal Kingdom! Our mission: to bring the majesty of the animal world to the digital age! 

As a developer for Animal Kingdom, it is your job to create a platform for intrepid biologists out in the field to record the various animal species they see out in the field. There are various Habitats (deserts, forests, grasslands, etc.), each **having many** different types of Animals!

We have provided you with some basic setup and a seed file to get you started. Make sure to take a tour of everything that we've created for you! 

(NOTE: Don't worry too much about the biological accuracy of the seed file! It's random!)
